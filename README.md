# A-Ballad-Of-NLP
This project was a cumulation of curiosity and hard work. The thought of us creating a model that is trained on lyrics of artists and then being able to create our lyrics from it was a great motivation for us as it was interesting as well as fascinating.

The 1st part of our project is finding a dataset. We decided to make our own instead of a predefined one. The lyrics or dataset which has been collected was done so via 2 main steps:

Collecting all the name of the songs along with the artists from Wikipedia. We have selected songs which have appeared in the Top-100 Billboard from 1959-2022.
We then make use of the details to scrap lyrics from various websites such as Genius.com being one of the websites
We then clean up the lyrics of the songs and then use it to train our model.

The 2nd part of our project is nothing but creating our own model to train using the lyrics and also a SOTA Model to compare both.

The 3rd and final part was to scrape data for 2 artists.

Panic! At The Disco
Bruno Mars
The reason we picked these 2 artists are due to the stark difference of the 2 wrt the music that they create. One is a Rock Band and the other is Pop Singer. We then use our 2 models to fine tune the weights and then create the lyrics of the 2 artists. Sounds fun right! Let's dive into it then shall we?
